## Learnings

In this course we learned how to use express to control our routes, making it easier to direct customers, we also use mongoose to manipulate data in an Atlas MongoDB database, in addition to creating all error handling, making our errors much more semantics.

With mongoose we did all the database creation, adding records, editing, retrieving, deleting, validating the entered data, retrieving using regex and paging the retrieval of records.

The content was very easy to absorb, I had some difficulties when using mongoose, as the version I used was superior to the one used in the course, and the previous version used callback functions, while the new version uses try/catch with async/await.

NodeMon was also used so that updates could be put into operation promptly.

We also learned how to use ESLint to standardize our documents and correct other errors.

Another useful tool was dotenv, used to create environment variables to keep sensitive data restricted.
